                    <h5>Four bodies</h5>
                    <p>I intended to overlap four bodies and to use the arms as legs of the still bodies to generate movement. This painting started as a pencil sketch with construction lines that outlined the bodies, so in the painting, I kept the element of lines that structure the figures. The color scheme of this painting is inspired by the dark neutral colors of cubism paintings and I framed the focal point of the painting with a dark green border. The accents of red were added after the rest of the painting was completed because I felt that a contrast to the dark green is necessary to further emphasize the relationship between the four figures and to enhance the motions of the bodies.</p>

                    <p>Despite the title, this is a self-portrait. For my first portrait, I decided to start by choosing a color scheme that fit my skin tone. I thought my skin tone was similar to the skin tone of Frida Kahlo in many of her self-portraits’ so I utilized the green background that Kahlo did in some of her paintings. Soon, the facial expression of the painting turned into a serious Frida-Kahlo-like expression. I associate big smiles and giggles with myself so rarely do I hold an expression like the one depicted in the self-portrait, and that’s why it’s “not a self-portrait”. But the process of analyzing my serious features has given me insight into how others may see me and has shown me another side of myself.</p>

                    <p>This is the second painting in the identity series. I utilized a bubble tea as the basis of my painting. The bottom of the tea consists of drinks that originated from the East and the West. Each of these drinks is meaningful for my childhood years in China and my teenage years in the U.S. These drinks were literally my new “boba” and metaphorically signifies a period of my life where I am starting to accept and understand both cultures as well as how both identities fit together. The title “DiversiTea” reflects my new understanding that I am a diverse person with distinct experiences and that both my identities contribute to who I am today.</p>

                    <p>This painting is part of a series that shows the process of understanding and accepting my cultural identities. In the painting are two doors, one is a Chinese door and the other a Western door. This is a representation of my initial struggle with my identity. I was born into a Chinese immigrant family in Canada, moved to China and finally moved to the U.S. at age 14. When I first moved here, I felt that I did not belong to either culture because of my background and that neither accepted me fully. The two closed doors and the crumpled up figure in the middle represent these feelings of loneliness and isolation from both cultures that I used to feel. </p>

The sets of structures all protrude out and suggest an in-progress assemblage of them. The color scheme of both panels is chosen from the exhibition Color Decoded at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. I felt that the large blocks of colors needed to be disrupted, so I decided to construct a second layer sewed in yarn. For this layer, I used three vanishing points on the left with different colored yarns to build up another perspective. The new layer disrupts the bottom layer and guides the viewer’s eyes throughout the painting.</p>

                    <p style="color:#000000;">This is the third and final piece in the identity series. This piece consists of three panels that signify three periods of my personal growth. All three come together to form an abstract dragon that takes the viewer through each of my roots and finally arrive at my new realization that both cultures nurture me and build up my identity but they don’t limit who I can be. Throughout the three frames, I used abstract shapes and the three primary colors to show my understanding that not one thing defines a culture or identity. The first one in predominantly red is about my Chinese roots and consists of the dragon’s head; the second one in blue and green is about my western roots; finally the third frame is the tail of the dragon and a sprout in the center representing how these roots have nurtured me and helped me grow into the person I am now. The title "Drag-on" is a play on words to reflect how the three connected panels drag on into a dragon. </p>

                    <p>This still life set consists of cool toned objects with a grey background and a warm light source. Through this still life, I am able to analyze how each individually cool objects’ interact with the warm lighting and especially how the silver pot reflects the light and its surrounding colors. The placement of the objects is strategic to create a balance by having different heights and colors. The purple eggplant stands out in the monochrome scene and was added later to create variety in the piece. This contrasting element adds more color to the painting and disrupts the color scheme of grey on grey.</p>

Each object in this setting is not purely one color but a mix of its surrounding colors with its original color. I explored how warm eggs behave in a cool setting and how white plates reflect the surrounding. The correct value is important in achieving a realistic depiction of the scene and this could only be done with the correct tones of color.</p>

                    <p>This painting is done only with palette knives. I utilized different styles and sizes of palette knives to build up colors. As acrylic paints dry fast, I used this to my advantage and proceeded to stack color on top of each other to create both physical and visual texture. I also dramatized the colors to further emphasize the values of the setting. </p>

The lines are the bust’s structure lines instead of light and shadow lines. And the lines are used to highlight the masculinity and fierceness in the sculpture’s expression. This study trained me to analyze busts structurally and how I could depict them by using varying line weights.</p>

I started the drawing with the chainsaw and decided to use line weights to show the structure of this machine. Then I added the gloves at the bottom left and used heavier lines to distinguish what is on top. From there I felt the frame was missing a bigger line, so I added the looper to break the unified machine. Finally, I wanted to add something to the empty top left corner and decided to put a glove that’s about to grasp the chainsaw. This is a further study of how to convey unity and emphasis in a drawing.</p>

                    <p style="color:#000000;">This geometric sketch is focused on the values the curves of the face and details each plane’s interaction with light, shadow, and reflections. The geometric bust helped me understand the values on each part of the face when I proceed to the following sketch. </p>

                    <p style="color:#000000;">For this sketch, I analyzed the transition between light and shadow and utilized comparing and contrasting techniques to achieve the most accurate depiction. Furthermore, I illustrated how light in shadows behave in comparison with its surroundings. The drawing is built up with lines cross-hatched rather than blended to create visual texture.</p>
